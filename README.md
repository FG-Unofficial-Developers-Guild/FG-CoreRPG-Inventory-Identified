# CoreRPG Party Inventory Identified
This extension makes it easier to see which party inventory items have been identified.
The original extension was created by [Llisandur](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/forums/member.php?61628-Llisandur).
A new column will be shown on the party inventory with ID'd/non-ID'd symbols.
Also, a "GM: Un-ID'd Names on PS" option has been added which shows the GM the non-ID'd name rather than the ID'd one on the party sheet.

# Compatibility and Instructions
This extension has been tested with [FantasyGrounds Unity](https://www.fantasygrounds.com/home/FantasyGroundsUnity.php) 4.1.13 (2022-01-05).
